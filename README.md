# Healthcare Dashboard in Power BI

## Project Overview

The **Healthcare Dashboard** project is designed to visualize and analyze healthcare data with a focus on various key metrics such as zones, gender, age groups, health risks, and other health-related factors. The dashboard aims to provide insights into health risk distribution across different zones, gender-wise analysis, stroke statistics, and obesity-related health patterns.

## Key Features

The Healthcare Dashboard includes the following key metrics and visualizations:

1. **Count by Zone**: Displays the total number of records in each geographical zone.
2. **Count by Gender**: Breaks down the count of records by gender (Male/Female).
3. **Count by Age Group**: Categorizes the data based on different age groups (e.g., 0-18, 19-35, 36-50, 51+).
4. **Count by Health Risk**: Shows the count of records grouped by various health risks (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
5. **Count by Zone and Health Risk**: Displays a breakdown of zones with corresponding health risks.
6. **Count by Zone and Stroke Status**: Shows how different zones relate to the number of people with a history of stroke.
7. **Zone of Female (Overweight vs. Not Overweight)**: Breaks down the zones where female individuals are categorized as overweight vs. not overweight.
8. **Zone of Male (Overweight vs. Not Overweight)**: Breaks down the zones where male individuals are categorized as overweight vs. not overweight.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For data visualization and report generation.
- **Excel or CSV Files**: As the data source (depending on your specific setup).

## Dashboard Components

1. **Zone Count**: A map visualization or bar chart that shows the number of individuals per zone.
2. **Gender Distribution**: A pie chart or bar graph to visualize the gender distribution in the dataset.
3. **Age Group Analysis**: A bar chart or stacked bar chart that categorizes individuals based on their age groups.
4. **Health Risk Analysis**: A column chart or matrix that shows the number of individuals categorized by their health risk (Low, Medium, High).
5. **Stroke Status by Zone**: A heat map or table showing the distribution of stroke incidents by zone.
6. **Female Overweight vs. Not Overweight**: A stacked bar chart visualizing female individuals categorized as overweight and not overweight, per zone.
7. **Male Overweight vs. Not Overweight**: A stacked bar chart visualizing male individuals categorized as overweight and not overweight, per zone.

## How to Use

1. Open the Power BI file and connect it to your dataset (Excel/CSV).
2. Load the data into the Power BI model.
3. Explore the dashboard by interacting with filters to view different zones, age groups, genders, and health-related statistics.
4. Use the slicers to filter data based on specific health risks, stroke history, or weight status.
